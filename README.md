# India-s-decision-firepower

This utilizes the dataset from Global Firepower Index to explore India's potential to become a dominant force in military power. The project employs Microsoft Excel's What-If Analysis and Solver features to develop various scenarios to evaluate India's military strength relative to other countries worldwide. The project offers valuable insights into the potential strategies for India to achieve dominance in global firepower. The project's findings and recommendations are useful for defense experts, policymakers, and anyone interested in understanding India's military power's potential.

This is a Decision Support Systems project that I made for my current semester. Feel free to give it a look! All of the code is recorded in the macros embedded excel file. The macros code could be employed on the given initial data to arrive at the same conclusion.
